# Alx Foundation - Fix My Code Challenge

## Background Context

The Fix My Code Challenge is a project designed to improve existing codebases by addressing and fixing issues within them. Whether you're familiar with the language used or not, this project offers an opportunity to enhance your debugging and problem-solving skills.

To get started, please download the [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master/status_server/api) repository and use it as the initial set of files for all solutions. Your goal is to fix the existing code without rewriting everything.

This project is entirely optional. Completing any part of it will boost your project grade by over 100% in your average score. Your average wonâ€™t be affected if you choose not to participate, but if your current average exceeds your score on this project, it could lower your overall average.
